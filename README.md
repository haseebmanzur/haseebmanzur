## 👋 Hi, I'm Seebi!

I'm a **bioinformatics enthusiast** with a strong interest in **microbiome-host interactions**, **multi-omic analysis**, and **machine learning applications** in biology. My work focuses on combining computational biology and bioinformatics to understand complex biological systems and diseases.

### 🔬 Current Projects
- **ARG-PRISM**: A machine learning-based framework for precise identification of **antibiotic resistance genes** from metagenomes.
- **Breast Cancer Microbiome Research**: Using metagenomic analyses to uncover **gut microbiome-metabolite signatures** in breast cancer patients. I recently presented this work at the ICiLS-24 conference at ASAB, NUST.
- **Cholera Outbreak Visualization Dashboard**: Developed as part of the **HackBio internship**, this dashboard analyzes global cholera trends from 1949 to the present.

### 📚 Research Interests
- **Microbiome-host interactions**
- **Cancer biology** (therapy resistance, tumor immunology)
- **Metagenomics** and **Antibiotic Resistance**
- **NGS data analysis** and multi-omics
- **Machine learning and computational modeling** for biological data

### 🎓 Education & Accomplishments
- Presented research at **ICiLS-24** on **Gut Microbiome-Metabolite Signatures** in breast cancer patients.
- Developed **bioinformatics pipelines** using tools like **BWA**, **BLAST**, and **Samtools**.
- Active member of the **ISCB Regional Student Council Pakistan Chapter** and organizer of a **Metagenomics workshop**.
  
### 🌱 Future Goals
- **PhD aspirations**: I'm applying to labs that focus on computational modeling, multi-omics, and cancer biology, including **Saez-Rodriguez**, **Zimmermann-Kogadeeva**, and **Bork** groups.
- Seeking to extend the **ARG-PRISM project** for future grants with ISCB.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, R, Shell scripting
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: BWA, BLAST, Samtools, AntiSMASH, Bioconda, and more.
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Biopython
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
